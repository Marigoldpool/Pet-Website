        <h3>Are Cats Helpful with Stress?</h3>
        <p>Cats are indeed proven to relive stress and anxiety. In fact, if you spend 15-20 minutes with your feline friend can calm your nerves and put you into a good mood. Scientists have proven this with chemical evidence. There is a chemical called serotonin that boosts feelings of well-being goes up, while your cortisol levels go down. Cortisol mixed with high blood pressure causes stress, which can lead to hypertension and high cholesterol. It’s that simple! Just cuddle with your feline friend and you will feel clam in no time!</p>

        <h3>They Help with Pest Problems</h3>
        <p>If you are worried about rodents and insects crawling around you house, your feline friend will take of it. Since your feline friend is an excellent hunter, they will take care of it. Even the most lazy of cats would enjoy a bit of cat and mouse every once and while.

          <h3>Shedding</h3>
          <p>Shedding is a cat’s natural way of losing its unwanted fur. It may be annoying to see your feline friend’s fur an over the place but it’s a way for them to maintain a certain body temperature. In the winter and fall feral/wild cats tend to grow more and thicker fur to maintain a suitable and comfortable body temperature, while in the spring and summer feral/wild cats tend to shed a lot of fur off to keep from overheating. Well, old Daisy over there sheds no matter on the season or temperature of your house. Now if your feline friend is starting to have bald spots, this may be caused by a health problem that they have that should be checked out by your local veterinarian. some things that causes your cat to shed are: allergies, ringworm, bacterial infection, fleas, poor diet, stress, hyperthyroidism which is a type of hormonal imbalance, sunburn, pregnancy/lactation, and certain medications. If you think you cat has any of these you should take him to the vet to check, better safe than sorry! Ways you can minimize your feline friend’s shedding is to: groom regularly and feed him a healthy, balanced diet. If you don’t tend to your cat’s fur often it would lead to matted and knotted fur, which is painful for your feline friend, and can cause unwanted skin problems. Treat your feline friend to a nice spa night, that’ll keep him happy and you too!
            <h3>Heat Cycles</h3>
                <p>Heat cycles occurs after onset puberty, which occurs in female cats at 6 months of age, a female cat will go into heat several times unless she is spayed. When this happens, she will become very aggressive and affectionate, and may exhibit behaviors such as loud vocalization and urine-spraying. She could end up with kittens if she encounters an unaltered male during this period. Unless you want kittens, please spay and neuter your cats!</p>

                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <h3>You Will Get Sick Less</h3>
                <p>When we disinfect it just makes us sicker because our microbiome is messed up due to our bodies being exposed to less germs. We need those germs so that we can fight them, so our bodies can get used to them. Dogs are covered in germs! Having dogs exposes us to diverse bacteria gets into the occupants, highly through pillowcases. In turn people who own dogs get sick less frequently than people with cats or no pets.</p>

                <h3>Exercise</h3>
                <p>While cats lower stress, dogs get you more active because dogs have a need to go walking or to be played with numerous times every day. Dogs owners get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, which lowers the rate of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) involves the heart and/or blood vessels. Cardiovascular disease includes diseased vessels, structural problems, and blood clots. A process called atherosclerosis, which is a condition that develops when plague builds up on the walls of arteries, causes cardiovascular disease. When this plague builds up it makes it hard for blood to flow through, in which blood cloths form. Your cute canine will lower your risks, so get one now!</p>

                  <h2>Cons</h2>
                  <h3>You Need a Lot of Stuff for a Dog</h3>
                  <p>When you get a dog, he’s not the only thing you need! You’ll need to buy treats, bowls, food, toys, leashes, collars, and much more! Don’t let your dog sleep on your bed of you don’t want him to because then he would get used to it and want to sleep there instead of the dog bed you bought him. Most items you need depend on the size and weight of the dog such as, food, bowls, beds, toys, and treats. Feeding a 15 lbs dog is much cheaper than feeding a 75 lbs dog. It’ll cost you more veterinary bills if you feed you dog inexpensive grocery store food, it’ll make them fart and it’s best to stay away from dogs when they fart, it’s potent!</p>

                  <h3>Training</h3>
                  <p>If you get a puppy, immediately potty train them. The sooner you train them the more used to it they will get and the more likely to go in that one place instead of on your floor or carpet. Potty training is the worst step for puppies or kittens because they are young and like to play instead of learning how to use the toilet. Dogs also require some sort of obedience training whether it be basic commands like “sit” and “stay” or something more elaborate. If you don’t know how to train a dog and need someone else to do it for you, it may cost you to hire someone or to go to classes. Before you get a dog the least thing you could do is research how to train a dog with basic commands.</p>
